# Module 8 Challenge - Forecasting with Net Prophet

## Project Overview

In this project, you will play the role of a growth analyst at Mercado Libre, the most popular e-commerce site in Latin America. With over 200 million users, understanding and predicting patterns in user behavior and stock performance can significantly influence the company's market strategies.

This challenge is divided into four main steps:

1. **Identifying Unusual Patterns**: Analyze Google search traffic data for unusual patterns.
2. **Mining Data for Seasonality**: Explore the search traffic data to find seasonal patterns of user interest.
3. **Correlating Search Traffic and Stock Prices**: Investigate the relationships between search traffic and stock price movements.
4. **Time Series Forecasting with Prophet**: Create a model using Prophet to predict future search traffic patterns.

## Instructions to Run the Notebook

To effectively run the notebook, please ensure you have completed the following setup:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas library
- Prophet library
- Matplotlib library
- Numpy library

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository**: Ensure that you have cloned the repository to your local machine.
2. **Install required libraries**: Run the following commands to install necessary libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib numpy prophet


3. **Open the notebook**:
Launch Jupyter Notebook in your environment.
Navigate to the directory containing the notebook.
Open the forecasting_net_prophet.ipynb notebook.


4. **Running the Notebook**:
Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially by pressing Shift + Enter.
Ensure that each step completes without errors before proceeding to the next.

5. **Viewing Results**:
Visualizations and outputs will be displayed directly below the code cells.
Review the outputs carefully to ensure that the analysis aligns with the project objectives.


### Conclusion
This project enables you to apply time series analysis techniques to real-world e-commerce data, providing valuable insights into user behavior and stock performance. By the end of this challenge, you should be able to predict search traffic patterns and relate these to financial events effectively.
