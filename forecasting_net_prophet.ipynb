It does appear generally however that the low point for Mercado Libre's stock price, late March to early April, did coincide with lower search activity for the firm. Search activity does pick up along with its stock price, although the stock price from mid-April onward definitively outpaces search interest.\n",

It looks like search traffic for the firm spiked about two hours before the firm's stock price spiked. This could indicate a predictable pattern (can Google Searches predict the stock price?), but an alternative explanation might just be that people tend to search for more information about the firm right before an earnings announcement gets released. We'd need to do a little more time-series research to see which explanation best fits the data."

With the correlation so close to zero, some might also say that there's almost no relationship between these two variables whatsoever, and that the small findings that we do have could be just due to chance. While there's no required threshold when looking at correlation between stock returns and the variables used to predict them, it does tend to be that correlations in this context tend to be very low across the board.
